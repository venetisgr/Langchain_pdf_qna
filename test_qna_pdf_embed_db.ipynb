The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement\\n\\nIn addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets). Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 29 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 70 of the Firm’s 2022 Form 10-K\\n\\nTangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $94.34, $90.29 and $86.16 at March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity\\n\\nAdjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense of $176mm, $27mm and $119mm for the three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance\\n\\nCorporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”) calculates the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans (“ALL/EOP”) excluding the impact of consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio\\n\\n10\\n\\nAdditional notes\\n\\n1.\\n\\n2.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nReflects the Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\") capital transition provisions. Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9B CECL capital benefit is being phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of March 31, 2023, CET1 capital and Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity reflected the remaining $1.4B CECL benefit; as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, CET1 capital reflected a $2.2B benefit. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of the Firm’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information\\n\\nTotal excess high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average eligible unencumbered liquid assets that are in excess of what is required to meet the estimated Firm and Bank total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress under the LCR rule. HQLA and unencumbered marketable securities, includes the Firm’s average eligible HQLA, other end-of-period HQLA-eligible securities which are included as part of the excess liquidity at the Bank that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates and thus excluded from the Firm’s LCR under the LCR rule, and other end-of-period unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities. Does not include borrowing capacity at Federal Home Loan Banks and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 of the Firm’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information\\n\\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the allocations of revenue and expense to CCB associated with a Merchant Services revenue sharing agreement were discontinued and are now retained in Payments in CIB.

The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.

       " Document(page_content='In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets). Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 29 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement.

For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end.

       " Document(page_content='Notes on non -GAAP financial measures\\n1. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these \\nFirmwide managed basis results are non -GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s \\ndefinition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and \\neach of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable -equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax -exempt securities \\nis presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures all ow management to assess the \\ncomparability of revenue from year -to-year arising from both taxable and tax -exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax -exempt items is \\nrecorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by t he lines of business. For a \\nreconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supp lement\\n2. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also revi ewsthese metrics excluding CIB \\nMarkets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets). Markets revenue consists of principal tran sactions, fees, commissions and other \\nincome, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non -GAAP financial measures. Management review s these metrics to assess the \\nperformance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset -liability management) and deposit -raising activities, apart from a ny volatility associated with Markets \\nactivities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, \\nsecurities that generate net interest income may be risk -managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal tr ansactions revenue. Management believes \\nthese measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reco nciliation of NII and NIR from reported \\nto excluding Markets, refer to page 29 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets re venue, refer to page 70 of the Firm’s \\n2022 Form 10 -K\\n3. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are e achnon-GAAP financial measures. \\nTCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill a nd identifiable intangible assets (other than \\nmortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings \\nRelease Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE . TBVPS represents the Firm’s \\nTCE at period -end divided by common shares at period -end. Book value per share was $94.34, $90.29 and $86.16 at March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March \\n31, 2022, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Fi rm’s use of equity\\n4. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non -GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense represents noninterest expen se excluding Firmwide legal \\nexpense of $176mm, $27mm and $119mm for the three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respecti vely. The adjusted overhead \\nratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of \\nthese items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance\\n5. Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”) calculates the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end -of-period loans (“ALL/EOP”) exc luding the impact of consolidated \\nFirm-administered multi -seller conduits and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance cove rage ratio\\n10', metadata={'source': 'files/JPM_FinancialResult.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these \\nFirmwide managed basis results are non -GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s \\ndefinition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and \\neach of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable -equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax -exempt securities \\nis presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures all ow management to assess the \\ncomparability of revenue from year -to-year arising from both taxable and tax -exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax -exempt items is \\nrecorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by t he lines of business. For a \\nreconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supp lement\\n2. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also revi ewsthese metrics excluding CIB \\nMarkets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets). Markets revenue consists of principal tran sactions, fees, commissions and other \\nincome, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non -GAAP financial measures. Management review s these metrics to assess the \\nperformance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset -liability management) and deposit -raising activities, apart from a ny volatility associated with Markets \\nactivities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, \\nsecurities that generate net interest income may be risk -managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal tr ansactions revenue.
